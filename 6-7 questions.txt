6.
 race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared resource concurrently
dead locks occurs when multiple threads are blocked indefinetly(same thread is trying to 
lock the mutex again)
 this two can be avoided by mimizing the shared resource
 by using proper lock and unlock of mutex
 by avoiding nested locks

7.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the existing process. Both the parent and 
child processes continue executing from the point of the fork() call. After fork(),
the parent and child processes have separate memory spaces but share the same code, data, 
and open file descriptors.
exec() functions replace the current process's memory space with a new program.
Unlike fork(), exec() doesn't create a new process instead, it transforms 
the existing process into a different one.

8.thread is a buildinf block of process, each thread do's individual task
where as process is a building block of a program
